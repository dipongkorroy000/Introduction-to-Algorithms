------ Graph Types ------                    
- Direction: 1. Directed                  * Graph vs Tree 
             2. Undirected                - main difference -> Cycle detection

- weight   : 1. Weighted                  * Graph -> Tree -> Binary Tree -> Binary Search Tree
             2. Unweighted

- Cycle    : 1. Cyclic
             2. Acyclic

            # Cyclic    * Undirected Cyclic Graph  |  * Directed Cyclic Graph
                         Node ----- Node           |
                            \      /               |     Node <----> Node
                             \    /                |
                              Node                 |


            # Acyclic        Node-----Node      or     Node-------Node
                            /   \
                           /     \
                        Node    Node

----- Input Graph -----
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List
- Edge List


* check 2 nodes connected or not:
adj_mat     -> O(1)
adj_list    -> O(N)
edge_list   -> O(N)

* check a single node connections
adj_list    -> O(N) // one of the best way
